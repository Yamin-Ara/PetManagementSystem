# pet_management

A one stop solution for everything related to pets. A place where pet owners can share content on their furry or feathered friends with the world while also getting emergency help from professionals on time. Moreover, altruists can post about endangered or abandoned animals in need of care to admins to review and then which rescuers and volunteers will be promptly made aware of so they can take proper action while keeping the community informed every step of the way.
